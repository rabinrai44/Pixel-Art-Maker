You'll be given starter code, including HTML and CSS, to build the application. You'll write JavaScript code that lets the user to create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

#### Your users should be able to:

Dynamically set the size of the table as an N by M grid.
Choose a color.
Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.
Your primary task is to implement the makeGrid() function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.

#### What Skills Do I Need?
In this project, you'll use your front-end programming skills from JavaScript Foundations and Intro to jQuery, including:

#### Defining variables with const and let
Accessing the DOM using methods of the document object
Declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects as event listeners
Writing nested loops and using loop variables
Although not a requirement, you are encouraged to use jQuery to manipulate the DOM for this project.
